    🧬 In July 2025, Moonshot AI released Kimi K2, a 1 trillion-parameter Mixture-of-Experts model (32B active) with open weights
    and strong performance in coding and complex tasks.
  capabilities:
    -  Designed for agentic use — carries out multi-step tasks using tools
    -  Excellent performance on benchmarks (LiveCodeBench, SWE-Bench) and real-world coding tasks
    -  Open-sourced, enabling fine-tuning and research
    -  🇨🇳 Seen as China’s answer to other open models like DeepSeek R1

kimi_ecosystem:
  description: >
    🌌 Kimi is evolving into an open ecosystem of foundation models (like K2, VL, Audio) aimed at deep reasoning, intelligent agent tasks,
    and developer empowerment.

ai_agent:
  definition: >
    🤖 An AI agent is an autonomous program powered by an LLM (like Kimi) that can:
  capabilities:
    -  Understand a task (via prompt or goal)
    -  Plan what to do
    -  Use tools (APIs, files, Python, etc.)
    -  Take actions and iterate
    -  Give a final response/output

learning_project:
  title: 📄 Build a File-Reading Agent
  objectives:
    -  Accepts a user query (e.g. "Summarize this PDF")
    -  Reads a PDF document
    -  Uses Kimi K2 to summarize the content
    -  Returns the result
```
